* Unicode version

Unicode version of test results depend on the Unicode version
implemented by Perl used to generate test results.  You can upgrade or
degrade the Unicode version of test results by regenerating them with
appropriate version of Perl.  At the time of writing (August, 2012),
the test results in the repository is generated by Perl 5.14.2, which
supports Unicode 6.0.0.

* Development

Latest version of the test suite is available at
<https://github.com/wakaba/tests-web-url>.

This test suite has first been developed in another repository
<https://github.com/wakaba/perl-weburl> in 2011 and then split into
different repositories.
